The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, a common mistake is to forget to add spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) within the `calc()` function.  For example, the following code is incorrect:

```css
.element { width:calc(25%+10px); }
```

This will likely be parsed incorrectly by many browsers. The correct syntax requires spaces around the operators:

```css
.element { width: calc(25% + 10px); }
```
